此枚举类型用于指定各种小部件属性。使用 `QWidget:setAttribute（）` 设置和清除属性，并使用 `QWidget:：testAttribute（）` 查询属性，有些属性具有特殊的便利功能，如下所述。

| Constant                                 | Value                 | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Qt::WA_AcceptDrops`                     | `78`                  | Allows data from drag and drop operations to be dropped onto the widget (see [QWidget::setAcceptDrops](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#acceptDrops-prop)()). |
| `Qt::WA_AlwaysShowToolTips`              | `84`                  | Enables tooltips for inactive windows.                       |
| `Qt::WA_ContentsPropagated`              | `3`                   | This flag is superfluous and obsolete; it no longer has any effect. Since Qt 4.1, all widgets that do not set WA_PaintOnScreen propagate their contents. |
| `Qt::WA_CustomWhatsThis`                 | `47`                  | Indicates that the widget wants to continue operating normally in "What's This?" mode. This is set by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose`                   | `55`                  | Makes Qt delete this widget when the widget has accepted the close event (see [QWidget::closeEvent](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#closeEvent)()). |
| `Qt::WA_Disabled`                        | `0`                   | Indicates that the widget is disabled, i.e. it does not receive any mouse or keyboard events. There is also a getter functions [QWidget::isEnabled](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#enabled-prop)(). This is set/cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_DontShowOnScreen`                | `103`                 | Indicates that the widget is hidden or is not a part of the viewable Desktop. |
| `Qt::WA_ForceDisabled`                   | `32`                  | Indicates that the widget is explicitly disabled, i.e. it will remain disabled even when all its ancestors are set to the enabled state. This implies WA_Disabled. This is set/cleared by [QWidget::setEnabled](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#enabled-prop)() and [QWidget::setDisabled](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#setDisabled)(). |
| `Qt::WA_ForceUpdatesDisabled`            | `59`                  | Indicates that updates are explicitly disabled for the widget; i.e. it will remain disabled even when all its ancestors are set to the updates-enabled state. This implies WA_UpdatesDisabled. This is set/cleared by [QWidget::setUpdatesEnabled](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#updatesEnabled-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_GroupLeader`                     | `72`                  | *This attribute has been deprecated.* Use [QWidget::windowModality](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#windowModality-prop) instead. |
| `Qt::WA_Hover`                           | `74`                  | Forces Qt to generate paint events when the mouse enters or leaves the widget. This feature is typically used when implementing custom styles; see the [Styles](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-styles-example.html) example for details. |
| `Qt::WA_InputMethodEnabled`              | `14`                  | Enables input methods for Asian languages. Must be set when creating custom text editing widgets. |
| `Qt::WA_KeyboardFocusChange`             | `77`                  | Set on a toplevel window when the users changes focus with the keyboard (tab, backtab, or shortcut). |
| `Qt::WA_KeyCompression`                  | `33`                  | Enables key event compression if set, and disables it if not set. By default key compression is off, so widgets receive one key press event for each key press (or more, since autorepeat is usually on). If you turn it on and your program doesn't keep up with key input, Qt may try to compress key events so that more than one character can be processed in each event. For example, a word processor widget might receive 2, 3 or more characters in each [QKeyEvent::text](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qkeyevent.html#text)(), if the layout recalculation takes too long for the CPU. If a widget supports multiple character unicode input, it is always safe to turn the compression on. Qt performs key event compression only for printable characters. [Qt::Modifier](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#Modifier-enum) keys, cursor movement keys, function keys and miscellaneous action keys (e.g. Escape, Enter, Backspace, PrintScreen) will stop key event compression, even if there are more compressible key events available. Platforms other than Mac and X11 do not support this compression, in which case turning it on will have no effect. This is set/cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_LayoutOnEntireRect`              | `48`                  | Indicates that the widget wants [QLayout](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlayout.html) to operate on the entire [QWidget::rect](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#rect-prop)(), not only on [QWidget::contentsRect](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#contentsRect)(). This is set by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_LayoutUsesWidgetRect`            | `92`                  | Ignore the layout item rect from the style when laying out this widget with [QLayout](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlayout.html). |
| `Qt::WA_MacNoClickThrough`               | `12`                  | This value is obsolete and has no effect.                    |
| `Qt::WA_MacOpaqueSizeGrip`               | `85`                  | Indicates that the native size grip should be opaque instead of transparent (the default). This attribute is only applicable to macOS and is set by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_MacShowFocusRect`                | `88`                  | Indicates that this widget should get a [QFocusFrame](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfocusframe.html) around it. Some widgets draw their own focus halo regardless of this attribute. Not that the [QWidget::focusPolicy](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#focusPolicy-prop) also plays the main role in whether something is given focus or not, this only controls whether or not this gets the focus frame. This attribute is only applicable to macOS. |
| `Qt::WA_MacNormalSize`                   | `89`                  | Indicates the widget should have the normal size for widgets in macOS. This attribute is only applicable to macOS. |
| `Qt::WA_MacSmallSize`                    | `90`                  | Indicates the widget should have the small size for widgets in macOS. This attribute is only applicable to macOS. |
| `Qt::WA_MacMiniSize`                     | `91`                  | Indicates the widget should have the mini size for widgets in macOS. This attribute is only applicable to macOS. |
| `Qt::WA_MacVariableSize`                 | `102`                 | Indicates the widget can choose between alternative sizes for widgets to avoid clipping. This attribute is only applicable to macOS. |
| `Qt::WA_MacBrushedMetal`                 | `46`                  | This value is obsolete and has no effect.                    |
| `Qt::WA_Mapped`                          | `11`                  | Indicates that the widget is mapped on screen. This is set/cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_MouseNoMask`                     | `71`                  | Makes the widget receive mouse events for the entire widget regardless of the currently set mask, overriding [QWidget::setMask](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#setMask)(). This is not applicable for top-level windows. |
| `Qt::WA_MouseTracking`                   | `2`                   | Indicates that the widget has mouse tracking enabled. See [QWidget::mouseTracking](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#mouseTracking-prop). |
| `Qt::WA_Moved`                           | `43`                  | Indicates that the widget has an explicit position. This is set/cleared by [QWidget::move](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#pos-prop)() and by [QWidget::setGeometry](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#geometry-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_MSWindowsUseDirect3D`            | `94`                  | This value is obsolete and has no effect.                    |
| `Qt::WA_NoBackground`                    | `WA_OpaquePaintEvent` | This value is obsolete. Use WA_OpaquePaintEvent instead.     |
| `Qt::WA_NoChildEventsForParent`          | `58`                  | Indicates that the widget does not want ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent to its parent. This is rarely necessary but can help to avoid automatic insertion widgets like splitters and layouts. This is set by a widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_NoChildEventsFromChildren`       | `39`                  | Indicates that the widget does not want to receive ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent from its children. This is set by a widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_NoMouseReplay`                   | `54`                  | Used for pop-up widgets. Indicates that the most recent mouse press event should not be replayed when the pop-up widget closes. The flag is set by the widget's author and cleared by the Qt kernel every time the widget receives a new mouse event. |
| `Qt::WA_NoMousePropagation`              | `73`                  | Prohibits mouse events from being propagated to the widget's parent. This attribute is disabled by default. |
| `Qt::WA_TransparentForMouseEvents`       | `51`                  | When enabled, this attribute disables the delivery of mouse events to the widget and its children. Mouse events are delivered to other widgets as if the widget and its children were not present in the widget hierarchy; mouse clicks and other events effectively "pass through" them. This attribute is disabled by default. |
| `Qt::WA_NoSystemBackground`              | `9`                   | Indicates that the widget has no background, i.e. when the widget receives paint events, the background is not automatically repainted. **Note**: Unlike WA_OpaquePaintEvent, newly exposed areas are **never** filled with the background (e.g., after showing a window for the first time the user can see "through" it until the application processes the paint events). This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent`                | `4`                   | Indicates that the widget paints all its pixels when it receives a paint event. Thus, it is not required for operations like updating, resizing, scrolling and focus changes to erase the widget before generating paint events. The use of WA_OpaquePaintEvent provides a small optimization by helping to reduce flicker on systems that do not support double buffering and avoiding computational cycles necessary to erase the background prior to painting. **Note**: Unlike WA_NoSystemBackground, WA_OpaquePaintEvent makes an effort to avoid transparent window backgrounds. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_OutsideWSRange`                  | `49`                  | Indicates that the widget is outside the valid range of the window system's coordinate system. A widget outside the valid range cannot be mapped on screen. This is set/cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_PaintOnScreen`                   | `8`                   | Indicates that the widget wants to draw directly onto the screen. Widgets with this attribute set do not participate in composition management, i.e. they cannot be semi-transparent or shine through semi-transparent overlapping widgets. **Note**: This flag is only supported on X11 and it disables double buffering. On Qt for Embedded Linux, the flag only works when set on a top-level widget and it relies on support from the active screen driver. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author. To render outside of Qt's paint system, e.g., if you require native painting primitives, you need to reimplement [QWidget::paintEngine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#paintEngine)() to return 0 and set this flag. |
| `Qt::WA_PaintUnclipped`                  | `52`                  | Makes all painters operating on this widget unclipped. Children of this widget or other widgets in front of it do not clip the area the painter can paint on. This flag is only supported for widgets with the WA_PaintOnScreen flag set. The preferred way to do this in a cross platform way is to create a transparent widget that lies in front of the other widgets. |
| `Qt::WA_PendingMoveEvent`                | `34`                  | Indicates that a move event is pending, e.g., when a hidden widget was moved. This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_PendingResizeEvent`              | `35`                  | Indicates that a resize event is pending, e.g., when a hidden widget was resized. This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_QuitOnClose`                     | `76`                  | Makes Qt quit the application when the last widget with the attribute set has accepted closeEvent(). This behavior can be modified with the [QApplication::quitOnLastWindowClosed](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#quitOnLastWindowClosed-prop) property. By default this attribute is set for all widgets of type [Qt::Window](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum). |
| `Qt::WA_Resized`                         | `42`                  | Indicates that the widget has an explicit size. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::resize](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#size-prop)() and [QWidget::setGeometry](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#geometry-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_RightToLeft`                     | `56`                  | Indicates that the layout direction for the widget is right to left. |
| `Qt::WA_SetCursor`                       | `38`                  | Indicates that the widget has a cursor of its own. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::setCursor](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#cursor-prop)() and [QWidget::unsetCursor](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#cursor-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_SetFont`                         | `37`                  | Indicates that the widget has a font of its own. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::setFont](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#font-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_SetPalette`                      | `36`                  | Indicates that the widget has a palette of its own. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::setPalette](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#palette-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_SetStyle`                        | `86`                  | Indicates that the widget has a style of its own. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::setStyle](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#setStyle)(). |
| `Qt::WA_ShowModal`                       | `70`                  | *This attribute has been deprecated.* Use [QWidget::windowModality](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#windowModality-prop) instead. |
| `Qt::WA_StaticContents`                  | `5`                   | Indicates that the widget contents are north-west aligned and static. On resize, such a widget will receive paint events only for parts of itself that are newly visible. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_StyleSheet`                      | `97`                  | Indicates that the widget is styled using a [style sheet](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html). WA_StyleSheet is set whenever a widget is subject to a style sheet, even if the style sheet did not affect the widget appearance. |
| `Qt::WA_StyleSheetTarget`                | `131`                 | Indicates that the widget appearance was modified by a [style sheet](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html). WA_StyleSheet will also be set. This value was introduced in Qt 5.12. |
| `Qt::WA_TabletTracking`                  | `129`                 | Indicates that the widget has tablet tracking enabled. See [QWidget::tabletTracking](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#tabletTracking-prop). |
| `Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground`           | `120`                 | Indicates that the widget should have a translucent background, i.e., any non-opaque regions of the widgets will be translucent because the widget will have an alpha channel. Setting this flag causes WA_NoSystemBackground to be set. On Windows the widget also needs the [Qt::FramelessWindowHint](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) window flag to be set. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_UnderMouse`                      | `1`                   | Indicates that the widget is under the mouse cursor. The value is not updated correctly during drag and drop operations. There is also a getter function, [QWidget::underMouse](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#underMouse)(). This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel. |
| `Qt::WA_UpdatesDisabled`                 | `10`                  | Indicates that updates are blocked (including the system background). This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel. **Warning**: This flag must *never* be set or cleared by the widget's author. |
| `Qt::WA_WindowModified`                  | `41`                  | Indicates that the window is marked as modified. On some platforms this flag will do nothing, on others (including macOS and Windows) the window will take a modified appearance. This flag is set or cleared by [QWidget::setWindowModified](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#windowModified-prop)(). |
| `Qt::WA_WindowPropagation`               | `80`                  | Makes a toplevel window inherit font, palette and locale from its parent. |
| `Qt::WA_MacAlwaysShowToolWindow`         | `96`                  | On macOS, show the tool window even when the application is not active. By default, all tool windows are hidden when the application is inactive. |
| `Qt::WA_SetLocale`                       | `87`                  | Indicates the locale should be taken into consideration in the widget. |
| `Qt::WA_StyledBackground`                | `93`                  | 指示应使用样式背景来绘制小部件。                             |
| `Qt::WA_ShowWithoutActivating`           | `98`                  | Show the widget without making it active.                    |
| `Qt::WA_NativeWindow`                    | `100`                 | Indicates that a native window is created for the widget. Enabling this flag will also force a native window for the widget's ancestors unless Qt::WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors is set. |
| `Qt::WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors`       | `101`                 | Indicates that the widget's ancestors are kept non-native even though the widget itself is native. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDesktop`       | `104`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDock`          | `105`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeToolBar`       | `106`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for [QToolBar](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtoolbar.html). |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeMenu`          | `107`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for [QMenu](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmenu.html) when torn-off. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeUtility`       | `108`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for the [Qt::Tool](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) window type. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeSplash`        | `109`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for the [Qt::SplashScreen](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) window type. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDialog`        | `110`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for the [Qt::Dialog](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) and [Qt::Sheet](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) window types. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDropDownMenu`  | `111`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DROPDOWN_MENU to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for [QMenu](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmenu.html) objects added to a [QMenuBar](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmenubar.html). |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypePopupMenu`     | `112`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for [QMenu](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmenu.html). |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeToolTip`       | `113`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLTIP to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for the [Qt::ToolTip](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowType-enum) window type. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeNotification`  | `114`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeCombo`         | `115`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_COMBO to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute for the [QComboBox](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcombobox.html) pop-up. |
| `Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDND`           | `116`                 | Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DND to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. **Note**: Qt automatically sets this attribute on the feedback widget used during a drag. |
| `Qt::WA_MacFrameworkScaled`              | `117`                 | This value is obsolete and has no effect.                    |
| `Qt::WA_AcceptTouchEvents`               | `121`                 | Allows touch events (see [QTouchEvent](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtouchevent.html)) to be sent to the widget. Must be set on all widgets that can handle touch events. Without this attribute set, events from a touch device will be sent as mouse events. |
| `Qt::WA_TouchPadAcceptSingleTouchEvents` | `123`                 | Allows touchpad single touch events to be sent to the widget. |
| `Qt::WA_X11DoNotAcceptFocus`             | `126`                 | Asks the window manager to not give focus to this top level window. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. |
| `Qt::WA_AlwaysStackOnTop`                | `128`                 | Since Qt 5.4, this value forces [QOpenGLWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qopenglwidget.html) and [QQuickWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickwidget.html) to be drawn last, on top of other widgets. Ignored for other type of widgets. Setting this attribute breaks the stacking order, but allows having a semi-transparent OpenGL widget with other widgets visible underneath. It is strongly recommended to call update() on the widget's top-level window after enabling or disabling this attribute. |
| `Qt::WA_ContentsMarginsRespectsSafeArea` | `130`                 | A [QWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html) respects the safe area margins of a window by incorporating the margins into its contents' margins by default. This means, that a [QLayout](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlayout.html) will use the content area of a widget for its layout, unless the Qt::WA_LayoutOnEntireRect attribute is set. This along with a contents margin of 0 can be used on the actual layout, to allow for example a background image to underlay the status bar and other system areas on an iOS device, while still allowing child widgets of that background to be inset based on the safe area. |
